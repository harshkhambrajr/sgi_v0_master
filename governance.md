# Governance — Cognitive Meta-Engine (CME)

**Author & Steward:** Harsh Khambra  
**Purpose:** Define authority, decision-making, and control mechanisms  
**Status:** Active · Binding for this repository

---

## 1. Why Governance Matters

CME explores long-horizon cognitive systems where **capability growth without control is a risk**.

Governance ensures that:
- safety mechanisms remain intact
- architectural coherence is preserved
- decisions are accountable
- the project remains stoppable and auditable

> **Good governance is a safety feature.**

---

## 2. Stewardship & Authority

### 2.1 Project Steward

The project steward and final decision authority is:

**Harsh Khambra**

The steward is responsible for:
- maintaining architectural integrity
- approving or rejecting high-risk changes
- enforcing safety and security policies
- resolving disputes
- representing the project publicly

This role is **not elected** and **not delegated by default**.

---

## 3. Decision-Making Model

### 3.1 Normal Changes

Examples:
- documentation updates
- new plugins within scope
- non-breaking CML additions

**Process:**
- Pull Request (PR)
- Maintainer review
- Merge or request changes

---

### 3.2 High-Risk Changes

Examples:
- kernel modifications
- force-field changes
- learning or meta-learning alterations
- changes affecting autonomy or control

**Process:**
- Detailed proposal
- Explicit steward approval
- Additional review or discussion

---

### 3.3 Emergency Decisions

In case of:
- safety violations
- force-field bypass attempts
- uncontrolled behavior

The steward may:
- pause development
- revert commits
- quarantine components
- trigger shutdown mechanisms

These actions do not require prior consensus.

---

## 4. Scope Control

### 4.1 In-Scope Work

- Simulation-first research
- Cognitive architecture exploration
- Declarative language design (CML)
- Safety and governance mechanisms

---

### 4.2 Out-of-Scope Work

- Real-world autonomous deployment
- Claims of AGI or ASI
- Physical embodiment
- Weaponization or control systems

Out-of-scope contributions will be rejected.

---

## 5. Contribution Alignment

All contributions must:
- follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- respect `SECURITY.md`
- align with `ROADMAP.md`
- acknowledge `ASSUMPTIONS.md`

Governance decisions prioritize **safety and coherence over popularity**.

---

## 6. Forks & Derivative Works

The project is released under the MIT License.

Forks are allowed provided that:
- attribution to the original author is preserved
- safety mechanisms are not misrepresented
- derivative projects clearly state deviations in scope or governance

Forks that claim AGI/ASI lineage without evidence are discouraged.

---

## 7. Conflict Resolution

In case of disputes:
1. Technical discussion is encouraged
2. Documentation and evidence take precedence
3. The steward makes the final decision

This ensures timely resolution and prevents fragmentation.

---

## 8. Governance Evolution

This governance model:
- may evolve slowly
- changes require steward approval
- cannot remove the steward role without explicit succession planning

---

## 9. Transparency & Accountability

- Major decisions are documented
- Rationale is recorded where appropriate
- Safety-related actions are logged

---

## 10. Final Statement

> **This project values responsibility over velocity.**

Governance exists to ensure that exploration of intelligence remains safe, honest, and controllable.
