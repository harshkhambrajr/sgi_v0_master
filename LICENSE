## Research & Safety Clarification (Non-Binding Addendum)

> This section is **not a restriction** on the MIT License.
> It is a clarification of intent, scope, and responsible use philosophy
> for contributors, researchers, and downstream users.

### 1. Purpose of This Software

This software is intended as a **research and experimentation platform** for:

* cognitive architectures
* modular intelligence systems
* simulations
* learning and reasoning experiments

It is **not** intended to be represented as:

* Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
* Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)
* a conscious or autonomous decision-making authority

### 2. No Claims of Intelligence or Sentience

The author makes **no claim** that this software:

* is intelligent in a human sense
* possesses awareness, intent, or consciousness
* operates independently of human oversight

Any such claims made by third parties are **not endorsed** by the author.

### 3. Real-World Deployment

The software is designed primarily for:

* simulations
* sandboxed environments
* research experimentation

Use of this software in **real-world autonomous systems** (physical, financial,
medical, military, or social control systems) is **strongly discouraged** unless
accompanied by appropriate safety, legal, and ethical review.

### 4. Responsibility of Use

Users and contributors acknowledge that:

* advanced computational systems can have unintended consequences
* responsibility for downstream use lies with the user
* safety mechanisms included in the project should not be removed lightly

### 5. Attribution & Stewardship

While the MIT License permits broad reuse, the author requests that:

* attribution to **Harsh Khambra** be preserved
* the original research intent not be misrepresented
* derivative projects clearly state modifications and scope changes

(This request is ethical in nature and does not override MIT permissions.)

### 6. Evolving Research Context

This project may evolve over time. Concepts, terminology, and architectural
choices should be understood as **experimental and provisional**, not final
claims about intelligence or reality.

---

## Summary

* The **MIT License remains fully valid and unchanged**
* This addendum exists to promote clarity, responsibility, and honest research
* No additional legal restrictions are imposed beyond MIT
